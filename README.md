# Samples for the PDF Services Java SDK

This sample project helps you get started with the PDF Services Java SDK.

The sample classes illustrate how to perform PDF-related actions (such as converting to and from the PDF format) using 
the SDK. **Please note that the PDF Services Java SDK supports only server side use cases.**

## Prerequisites
The sample application has the following requirements:
* Java JDK : Version 8 or above.
* Build Tool: The application requires Maven to be installed. Maven installation instructions can be found 
[here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).


## Authentication Setup

The credentials file for the samples is ```pdfservices-api-credentials.json```.
Before the samples can be run, set the environment variables `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID` and `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET` from the `pdfservices-api-credentials.json` file downloaded at the end of creation of credentials via [Get Started](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/gettingstarted.html?ref=getStartedWithServicesSdk) workflow by running the following commands :

1. For MacOS/Linux Users :
```$xlst
export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>
export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>
```

2. For Windows Users :
```$xlst
set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>
set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>
```

The SDK also supports providing the authentication credentials at runtime, without storing them in a config file. Please
refer this [section](#create-a-pdf-file-from-a-docx-file-by-providing-in-memory-authentication-credentials) to 
know more.

## Client Configurations

The SDK supports setting up custom socket timeout or connect timeout for the API calls. Please
refer this [section](#create-a-pdf-file-from-a-docx-file-by-providing-custom-value-for-timeouts) to
know more.

The SDK also supports setting up Proxy Server configurations which helps in successful API calls for network where all outgoing calls have to go through a proxy else, they are blocked. Please
refer this [section](#create-a-pdf-file-from-a-docx-file-by-providing-proxy-server-settings) to
know more.

Additionally, SDK can be configured to process the documents in the specified region.
Please refer this [section](#export-a-pdf-file-to-a-docx-file-by-providing-the-region) to know more.

## Quota Exhaustion

If you receive ServiceUsageException during the Samples run, it means that trial credentials have exhausted their usage
quota. Please [contact us](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_requestform) to get paid credentials.

## Build with maven

Run the following command to build the project:
```$xslt
mvn clean install
```

Note that the PDF Services SDK is listed as a dependency in the pom.xml and will be downloaded automatically.

## A Note on Logging
For logging, this SDK uses the [slf4j API](https://www.slf4j.org/) with a log4j2-slf4j binding. The logging configurations 
are provided in ```src/main/resources/log4j2.properties```. Alternate bindings, if required, can be specified in pom.xml.

## Running the samples

The following sub-sections describe how to run the samples. Prior to running the samples, check that the configuration 
file is set up as described above and that the project has been built.

The code itself is in the ```com.adobe.pdfservices.operation.samples``` package under the ```src/main/java/``` folder. Test 
files used by the samples can be found in ```src/main/resources/```. When executed, all samples create an ```output``` 
child folder under the working directory to store their results.
